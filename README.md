mau\Lu is a fairly simple URL shortening backend written in Go. The first versions also contain support for a frontend. The code at commit [3fc7b2d](https://github.com/tulir293/maulu/commit/3fc7b2d002af1da81af6a5cf2d69e8ddac415a69) is confirmed to work with a basic HTML-only frontend.

A fancy frontend can be found from [mau.lu](https://mau.lu/). I might release the frontend properly at some point. For now, the sources of mau.lu are available at [maunium/mau.lu](https://github.com/maunium/mau.lu).

See the [OpenAPI spec](spec.yaml) https://spec.maunium.net/maulu for the API details.
